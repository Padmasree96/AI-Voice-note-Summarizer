# 🎙️ AI Voice Note Summarizer

AI Voice Note Summarizer is a simple and intelligent web application that helps convert voice notes into text and generate short, meaningful summaries.  
The application supports both **Tamil and English** speech and is designed to make audio content easier to understand, review, and reuse.

This project combines **speech recognition**, **language translation**, and **AI-based text summarization** into one easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
